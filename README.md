Install go on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---

  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  vars:
    go_packages:
      - github.com/golang/dep

  roles:
    - robertdebock.go
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml

  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.buildtools
    - role: robertdebock.git
```
